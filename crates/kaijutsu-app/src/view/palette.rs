//! interior (`docs/scenes/`): one hue language across the Tardis room and the
//! stations standing inside it (Amy, 2026-07-10 — "unifying styles across the
//! tardis / patch bay").
//!
//! **Material discipline** (the room's rule, now scene-family-wide): every
//! material is built-in `StandardMaterial` with `unlit: true`, brightness
//! carried in `base_color` — LDR (< 1.0 linear) reads as calm etched
//! structure, HDR (> 1.0) blooms through the app camera's threshold-1.0
//! bloom and is reserved for **live activity**. No point lights, no lit
//! metals: the 2026-07-10 tuning pass proved a ~1%-albedo metallic surface
//! swallows any lamp — emissive-on-dark is the concepts' look anyway.
//!
//! **Amendment (Amy, 2026-07-10 — "make the circuit patterns and border glow
//! faintly like the concepts... something faintly moving might be
//! interesting"):** decoration may now ALSO carry a faint, slowly moving
//! glow on top of that discipline — a traveling-wave crest (circuit traces,
//! wall trim) or a slow uniform breath (terminal pads, the inscribed ring),
//! rendered by [`crate::shaders::TraceGlowMaterial`]
//! instead of `StandardMaterial`. The crest may exceed 1.0 up to
//! [`GLOW_CREST`] (the bloom pass haloes it softly), but the element's
//! resting `trough` level times the crest stays under 1.0 — LDR on
//! time-average. Strong SUSTAINED HDR (a marker at full activity lift, the
//! console under chatter) stays reserved for live activity; the difference
//! from the faint glow is duration and cause, not the bloom threshold
//! itself.
//!
//! Hues are linear-rgb `[f32; 3]` identity colours; multiply by an LDR tier
//! before handing them to a material (`room::lin_scaled` et al.).

// content"; studio patch bays are wall panels; concept 06 draws the W
// station wall-mounted with threads dropping into the floor traces). This
// supersedes the dais contract (`STATION_W_X`/`_DAIS_TOP_Y`/`_DAIS_R`, all
// deleted here, along with `room::spawn_w_dais`, the furniture builder that
// read them): the wheel no longer stands on furniture at W, it hangs on the
// wall itself, re-oriented face-out by `patch_bay::STATION_W_PLACEMENT`'s
// pitch+yaw (`patch_bay.rs`'s doc on that constant has the quaternion
// derivation). These constants remain the one shared agreement between the
// two files — `room::spawn_walls` builds the W panel, reading `WALL_APOTHEM`
// from here; `patch_bay`'s placement reads all four to seat the wheel flush
// against that same panel — so neither file can drift without the other
// noticing here.

/// Octagon wall apothem (center-to-face distance) — moved here from
