//! HUD Widget implementations
//!
//! Built-in widgets that can be displayed in HUD panels.
//! Each widget is a function that generates content string from Bevy resources.

// Widget implementations are in mod.rs for now (generate_* functions)
// This module will expand to include more complex widget rendering
// as the HUD system matures.

// Re-export nothing for now - widgets are generated inline
